Control the left paddle with the "R" and "F" keys ("R" is up, "F" is down),
and control the right paddle with the up and down keys. The maximum
computer level is 10, the maximum number of balls is 10, and the maximum
acceleration is 1. You can optionally control at most one of the paddles by moving
the mouse. That option is probably best, especially when you have two humans playing,
since most keyboards don't do so well when multiple keys are pressed at once!
